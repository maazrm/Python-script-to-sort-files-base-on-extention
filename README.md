How It Works

    OrganizeFileScript.py: When you run this script, it automatically sorts all files in the current directory into their respective folders based on their file extensions.

    OrganizeFileScriptWithVoiceCommand.py: This version of the script listens for a voice command. You can either command it to organize all files, or specify certain files to be sorted into their corresponding folders based on file extensions.

Libraries/Modules Used

    shutil: To move files to their respective folders.
    speech_recognition: To enable voice command functionality.
